# Decision Tree VS Linear Regression

Comparing Decision Tree and Linear Regression Algorithms
There is a dataset on the number of bicycles people rent by the hour and day in Washington, D.C. The data can be downloaded here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset

The target column for prediction is
'cnt' - The total number of bike rentals (casual + registered)

In this project, we will predict the total number of bikes people rented in a given hour,
so I will predict the 'cnt' column using all of the other columns, except for casual and registered.

I will apply two machine learning algorithms to compare results, which one would give us the more accurate prediction.
